# What does this do?: 
This plugin takes an HTML string, adds each character to an array and ouputs them sequentially to the DOM.

## How do I use it?
For each element you want to run the plugin on, give it a class of "typeText":

`<p class="typeText">Wow, this is like the coolest plugin EVER.</p>`
  
Then create the function call at the very bottom of the code:
  
`intThis();`
